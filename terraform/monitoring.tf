# Basic monitoring: alarm fires if target group has unhealthy hosts.
# ECS itself already auto-replaces failed tasks (that's the "self-healing"
# your demo audience actually cares about) - this alarm is the visibility
# layer on top, and a place to hang an SNS->Lambda hook later if you want
# custom remediation logic.
